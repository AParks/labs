Forms are like a table or spreadsheet. Form records are the submissions collected from people filling out the form. The standard app znData tab displays this data as a spreadsheet, with the form fields as columns and the form records as the rows.

The idea behind the Record Board plugin is to offer a different visualization and way of working with this form data. The Record Board plugin will display this data similar to kanban boards as columns of lists. Form folders will be used as columns containing lists of records.
