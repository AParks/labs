This plugin solves a really common problem around the office at Zengine - taking lunch orders. Rather than emailing in all the orders or scratching them down on a pad, we use this plugin. It allows someone to choose the place we're ordering from, and then let everyone else write in what they want. Thanks to Firebase, everyone sees the orders coming through in real time.

## Installation
1. Create a plugin with a name and namespace.
2. Find and replace the word 'namespaced' with your new namespace.
3. Copy and paste the updated contents of each file into their respective places in the plugin editor of the Zengine developer tool.
4. In Firebase, create a new app.
5. Replace the Firebase URLs in the plugin's JavaScript with your own
