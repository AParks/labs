## Installation
In the HTML and JavaScript files, find and replace the word 'namespaced' with a namespace of your choosing. Create a plugin with that namespace and copy and paste the contents of each file into their respective files in the plugin editor of the Zengine developer tool. In Firebase, create a new app. Copy and paste the contents of the security.json file into the security rules section of your Firebase app dashboard. In the publishing settings of the Zengine developer tool, update the Firebase URL and Firebase secret key.
